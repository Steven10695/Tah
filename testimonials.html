        “A Colonial Mansion Turned into a Hotel” <br>
        We arrived here very late as we had taken the train from Aguas Calientes and Machu Picchu to Ollantaytambo, then back to our hotel in Yucay to get our luggage and then back into Cusco. It was a very long day as we arrived after 8:30 and exhausted. The three young men, Jhon, (that's how they spell John in Peru!), David and ??.. the front desk helped us promptly, got us to our room, and had dinner waiting for in the dining room. There was a space heater for us as the room was very cold but it warmed up nicely! <br>
        Breakfasts were super with eggs made the way you asked for them, fresh fruit and someone always there to help you. The atmosphere was so lovely with it being a former Colonial mansion.
      </li>

        “A gem” <br>
        Stayed here for 4 nights and became our home in Cusco very quickly. This hotel is right next to a supermarket and the San Pedro market. It's about a 10 min walk to Plaza de Armas, so great bang for your buck here. What makes this place so great is their staff. They hustle for you, for everything! I've never seen such hardworking individuals, not even in America. They definitely deserve good tips! Wifi connectivity depends on your room. Rooms are a bit dated but they come with a comfy bed, fridge, heater and safe. Rooms are a bit loud on first floor but we rarely slept in since we were always on the go :). Breakfast is good, the cook makes your eggs fresh right in front of you! <br>
        Thank you Terra Andina staff for giving us such a great home away from home! I can't rave about them enough. We were so sad to leave Cusco and Terra Andina. We will definitely be back here on your second visit to Cusco! Chao!
      </li>
      <li>
        A Great review is always a nice surprise! I want to Thank the Staff for a wonderful time here. <br>
        I also come from a hotel/restaurant background and know the treatment of the guest is your first concern. I was treated very well and often with a smile!
        I hope all get to see this letter, because your great service and smiles made me take the time from my vacation to write it. 
        The TIP here should be spread equally as it taken a great team like you have here, to make this awesome guest experience. <br>

        A nice place, with much light in the interior patio where a small restaurant provides the essential items for a good starter in the mornings and a reasonable priced dinner at night. We did not eat lunch here. Staff is friendly and always concerned about your well-being. Like all other hotels in Cusco, there is an early start every day it seems, for guests departing for the Machu Picchu train. The location of Terra Andina is fantastic!!
      </li>
      <li>
        This hotel has a very friendly atmosphere. From the moment we arrived, they offered us hot coca tea, which was good in the cold weather and also feels rejuvenating when you start feeling the effects of the high altitude. The hotel manager came to greet us personally, and all amenities and services we requested were there. We had a nice balcony/French door area with a nice view of the area of San Pedro. Everything here was just fine!
      </li>
      <li>
        Stayed at Terra Andina before and after Machu Picchu. Restaurant food was phenomenal and the service was great. Staff could not have been friendlier. Ask for Ivan - the guy KILLS it. Made our trip so much better. He arraigned a great tour of the Sacred Valley for us (HIGHLY recommended).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stayed at Terra Andina hotel for 4 nights (2 nights before the Machu Picchu trek and 2 nights after) and enjoyed the hotel very much. This property deserves five stars. It is small but well maintained We were picked up the airport by the hotel shuttle for free. The property itself is kind of hidden from the main street but when you enter inside, it is very clean and refreshing. The location is about 10 min walk to the main plaza where all the restaurants and bars are located. The hotel is well managed. The staff is very courteous and willing to assist when needed. The front desk staff speak good English and very helpful. The food served at the restaurant is very high quality and the Chef is VERY GOOD. I had one of the best Vegetable Pastas of my life for dinner in the restaurant. The waiters were service oriented. The breakfast buffet included in my rate was awesome & abundant with freshly cooked to order eggs, breads, cereals, fruits and juices. The papaya juice was tasty. EXCELLEND VALUE FOR THE MONEY! 
      </li>
      <li>
        Stayed two nights in this hotel. Very nice, wonderful buffet breakfast (included in my room rate). Clean, lovely rooms. Close to San Pedro marketplace and a grocery store. Had hot coca leaf tea ready to help with any altitude sickness. The staff spoke English and were very accommodating. 
      </li>
      <li>
        We had to check out of Llaqtayay B & B early due to my cold/flu symptoms and needing a clean bathroom and some heating. This did not disappoint and we had a wonderful stay. <br>
        Fantastic location, great service and great buffet breakfast. Nothing but compliments for this small but very well run and very clean hotel.
      </li>
      <li>
        We found the staff to be friendly and accommodating. The intimate nature of the property promoted an environment where you would repeatedly see the same staff members and they knew you were a guest. Many of them spoke English to the extent to overcome a language barrier. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Great experience - we were a group of 4 friends staying in 2 rooms. Clean, quiet hotel with great breakfast - they make custom omelets for you! Very friendly staff.
      </li>
      <li>
        For us this was a perfect stay in every way. The staff was overall very friendly and not hesitant in helping us with any issue big or small. They sorted out our Machu Picchu trip in a very convenient way for us. The hotel is situated on a very calm street yet in close walking distance from the city center. Breakfast which is included in the price is excellent, varied with extra plus for the fresh omelets made on the spot at your convenience. We also would like to give an extra plus for the complimentary pick up service at the airport upon arrival.
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed in the hotel for about four nights and it is conveniently situated close to the centre of Cusco. The hotel staff was very friendly and provided excellent service. <br>
        We had a slight problem in the bathroom of our first room and we were immediately upgraded to a suite which was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately we needed some medical attention during the night and the staff arranged this quickly for us. We left a suitcase with them while we travelled onwards and this was easy to arrange. After the Machu Picchu trip we returned to the hotel to find they had kept the suite available for our last night. Very nice gesture and much appreciated. Lovely eating area and very good staff. I would recommend this as a place to say without any hesitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        After reading the other reviews of this hotel on Tripadvisor I booked the hotel. <br>
        This hotel certainly did not disappoint. It is in a great location, quiet and clean. Staff extremely friendly. Very good breakfast that is included.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed there the night before our train ride to Machu Picchu and then there again when we came back. We left our main suitcase at the hotel and then just took a small roller-board suitcase for the two days we stayed in Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu).
      </li>
      <li>
        We were family group of four adults and two children. We spent 4 nights at this hotel and found it very comfortable and conveniently located. The staff is extremely polite and ready to any help you need. They have pick up service from the airport to the hotel. The rooms are of decent size and hotel inside atmosphere is quite. The eating area is under glass covered open sky and adds to the beauty of the hotel. There is a local market at end of street where hotel is located and a super market for anything you might need as a traveler. The main square, a tourist attraction, is about 10-minute walk. The walk itself takes you through variety of shops and restaurants. I would recommend this hotel to all visitors to Cusco.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hotel was beautiful. Staff was excellent. Breakfast buffet was fantastic. Service to and from hotel was excellent. Hotel within walking distance of main plaza but is in a nice quiet area.
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed here before and after our Inca Trail hike. The beds were very comfortable and the price quite reasonable, which I had seen in reviews and why we chose it. This is a little far from the main square, but only about a 10 minute walk during the day and cabs weren't expensive at night. The staff was very friendly and we felt safe leaving our bags there for the four days Inca hike. Breakfast was wonderful, with fresh juices and a great variety of food. <br>
        My only issue was that the water pressure wasn't that great in the showers, but not sure if it is anywhere in the country.
      </li>
      <li>
        We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The hotel picked us up from the airport and the personnel were extremely friendly and helpful. We were given Coca Leaf Team as soon as we arrived and were told we were free to help ourselves for more when we needed it. The rooms we got were properly sized, clean and comfortable. The breakfast in this place was impressive. The buffet is plentiful and you get a chance to sample both international and local food. Everything on the menu is delicious and fresh-made.
      </li>
      <li>
        What a stunning place. The rooms were gorgeous with lovely large paintings and comfy beds. Only downside was breakfast finished early and we couldn't get a late check in (which is what we really were looking forward to after the Machu Picchu trek!) other than that, staff were very welcoming. Note from Management: Guests are welcome to request breakfast a-la-carte, free of charge, at any given time. 
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed at the Terra Andina for four nights and loved the stay. They have the most comfortable beds which was a treat during our travels. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We thought the rooms were wonderfully comfortable, clean, and spacious. <br>
        Pros: Good breakfast (omelets, fruit, cereal, breads, pancakes...etc.). Friendly staff. Free internet (with 2 computer stations to use). Good tea available 24 hours a day. Comfy beds. Clean rooms. Hot water. TV <br>
        Cons: 8:00 am checkout (too early in my opinion). Location is a little far from the Plaza de Armas. About a 10 -15 minute walk
      </li>
      <li>
        Terra Andina Hotel is tucked away on a one way side street. Discrete entry opens up into a delightful, sunny courtyard, we were welcomed by friendly staff with coca tea, and rooms were immaculately clean, comfortable and warm. The efficient and friendly service made us wish we were staying for more than 2 nights. Computer access was free and good money exchange rate at the front desk. The shops and markets were at the end of the street and the historic plazas and malls within easy walking distance. In all our travels throughout South America, our stay at the Terra Andina Hotel was memorable because of the friendly and personal attention we received. Love to go back.
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed in Hotel Terra Andina for three nights in Cuzco. It was a very good experience. <br>
        The hotel itself is quaint. By no means a brilliantly deccorated hotel, but very well done indeed. Hotel staff was both friendly and helpful. Service was generally very good. <br>
        Breakfast buffet was an excellent way to start the day. I would stay there again and recommend others to stay there.
      </li>
      <li>
        The greeting of the friendly staff, the comfortable seats in the covered courtyard, and the coca tea are the first impression of this hotel. Our room was very nice with a clean well-appointed bath. Free Wi-Fi for those who brought their computer and free computers with internet access for those who haven't is available. The breakfast buffet was surprisingly good. A Super Market is close by on the same street. The hotel is a short walk to the Plaza de Armas and the Inca Museum. For those having withdrawal, there is a Starbucks at the Plaza. The most memorable part of our stay here was the wonderful staff! If/when we return to Cusco, we will return to the Terra Andina Hotel.
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed here one night before our Machu Picchu adventure and three days after. We were going to move to a more expensive hotel after Machu Picchu, but were so charmed by the Terra Andina, that we changed our plans. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We felt very comfortable and at ease. Our room was beautiful with a huge bathroom. We loved the central courtyard with light streaming in from a huge skylight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quite by accident, we met the owner of Terra Andina on the flight to Cuzco. He was a gentleman and was not only committed to our experience as his guests (we already had reservations), but also had suggestions for activities in the area. The building itself, a converted mansion, is unique, charming, and is a reminder of the impressive history of Cuzco. The food is excellent, and I would be remiss if we didn't mention the high level of professionalism and friendliness of the staff. Every one of them was kind and helpful.
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed here for three days before our Inca Trail Trek and one day post-trek and had a great experience. The rooms were clean and well kept. Service was great and the front desk was very helpful. We found the location to be quite convenient and were able to walk all around town to check out restaurants and bars. Breakfast included with the room is quite nice- good selection and not just cold rolls and juice. They usually had hot items, a large variety of juices and beverages, hot coffee and hot water for tea. They have coca tea available at any time for those acclimated to the altitude. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Cusco.
      </li>
      <li>
        We stayed at the hotel the night before we started the Inca trail and two nights after. <br>
        We were very surprised upon arrival, the hotel is very clean and spacious - their web site does not do the hotel justice!! Upon arrival we were taken to the sitting area and given a piece of cake and cup of coca tea, very relaxing start. <br>
        The rooms are very big, with a huge double bed (super super king size!) - we could both star fish out and barely touch each other!!! The room its self is large and bright and has beautiful traditional carvings on wood panels around the room (see photo). Breakfast and dinner were both excellent, with a good selection of traditional Peruvian dishes. <br>
        Breakfast was laid out on a long table with every imaginable thing to eat (see photo)! <br>
        The location of the hotel is on a side street, about a 10 minute walk to the main square (Plaza de Armas), it is in a pretty good area (near a market and supermarket etc.) If you are staying in Cusco stay here - closer to the plaza it gets very expensive for a lesser hotel!
      </li>
      <li>
        My boyfriend and I stayed here in our attempt to acclimate to the elevation before heading up to Machu Picchu. Originally, we were looking for a convenient location and good price, but ending up stumbling upon incredible service. The entire staff was very helpful and super friendly. They gave great advice and directions and helped us with all sorts of things including providing an oxygen tank for 10 minutes when one of us was having issues with elevation, arranging for a private driver for the day, and getting a doctor for a house call.

        We stayed at Terra Andina before we left for our trek along the Inca Trail and then stayed again on our way back. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The location is very central and the rooms are clean and modern. The breakfast is great. If I were to go back to Cuzco I would stay at Terra Andina again and I would recommend to my friends.

        Just back from five days in Cusco and Incan environs en route to spectacular Machu Picchu. We found the Terra Andina on TripAdvisor site and were very, very pleased - completely agree with the excellent reviews, What to add? . Friendly and helpful staff, welcoming pick-up by terrific Ivan at airport, very comfortable beds and most attractive room (#112), ample and delicious breakfasts with excellent waiters (Benigno and others), just far enough away from hustle/bustle of center but an easy walk and with a most colorful market only a half-block away, computer accessibility; front desk expertly arranged for a day's taxi to outlying Incan sites. Terra Andina was a terrific place to stay in Cusco,

        We stayed six nights in total (in three different times over a ten day period) at Terra Andina hotel, and had a great experience. We tried various rooms. All were very comfortable, with thick duvet. Hotel is located in lovely colonial style house, with inside patio. Breakfast buffet offers good variety, and includes fresh fruit juices. Hotel attendants were very helpful to organize day trips, and tried hard to get us good rates with local cabs. Hotel is located 5-10 min walk from Plaza de Armas and most restaurants.
